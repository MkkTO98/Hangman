# Hangman
A simple python hangman game.
I started "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course on Udemy, on day 7 we are challenged and guided through how to make our own simplified hangman game.
It is a small step but completing it and adding additional content and personalization to it made it feel like a worthy milestone to upload on my newly created, yet empty, github account.
